  On Tuesday I'll be guest-hosting CNBC's Squawk Box, a program that bills
  itself as the show that "brings Wall Street to Main Street." As well as
  discussing Cyprus and a possible euro-crisis, we are going to discuss the
  growing trend in corporate America of taking steps -- meditation, yoga,
  mindfulness trainings -- to reduce stress and improve health and creativity.
